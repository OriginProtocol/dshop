# Backend

The backend consists of:

* A realtime connection to an Ethereum node listening for relevant events on the

  Origin Marketplace contract

* A database containing up to date customer order information
* An emailer for sending out receipts and notifications
* An off-chain payment processor for accepting credit card orders and putting

  them on-chain

* An API for sellers to view and manage orders

The backend can be hosted by any individual or third party provider.
