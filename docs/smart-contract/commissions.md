# Commissions

A successful marketplace requires both buyer and sellers, but how do buyers find
the items they wish to purchase? Marketing and ads are a common solution: a
seller will purchase ads or otherwise market their product in the hope a buyer
will see it and make a purchase. Paying for ads does not guarantee sales,
however.

The Marketplace takes a different approach by allowing sellers to incentivize
affiliates to find buyers on their behalf by offering a commission on sales.
This commission is paid once a purchase is complete, so affiliates are
incentivized to make sales instead of simply driving traffic.
