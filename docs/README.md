# What is Origin Protocol?

Airbnb, Uber, Craigslist, E-bay, Shopify, Etsy... all of these sites help
facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers. A seller lists some goods or
services for sale. A buyer makes a purchase from that seller. The marketplace
facilitating the transaction usually takes a fee, either from the seller, the
buyer, or both. Sometimes the fees are exorbitant, but buyers and sellers are
willing to pay in order to obtain access to the network, tools that make buying
and selling easy, customer service, insurance, etc.

Signing up to these services comes at a price, however, and not just the
transaction fees.
